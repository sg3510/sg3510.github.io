# Interests

I usually try to stay open-minded and curious about various things, but areas that I'm particularly interested in are:

- **AI Dev Tooling:** When building Hedge I taught myself Rust and got back into coding just before LLMs became popular and have had even more fun coding with all of the new tools (eg coding clis) that are accelerating my coding productivity.
- **Fitness / Health:** Not just regularly exercising but how we can stay healthy for longer as we age. I enjoy fitness monitoring but often question the value of over self-quantification without concrete results.
- **Medicine:** Having undergone [ankle transplant surgery](http://drbugbee.com/bipolarAnkleAllograft.html), a rare procedure few surgeons I talked to knew about, I'm deeply interested in how doctors make decisions for their patients and how we can help patients better understand their options when doctors themselves don't know all the possibilities. I'll usually have a lot of fun going through all the papers related to the treatment of a condition to understand how the doctors came to agree on the best way forward. LLMs make this even easier.
- **Hardware:** I studied electrical & electronic engineering mostly because I like to play with and understand what software runs on. I occasionally hack some hardware projects together, such as self-balancing controllers.
- **Music:** I actually enjoy a wide range, from classical to electronic music. I used to play flute and piano as a kid but have definitely gotten very rusty now.
- **Video Games:** While I used to play a lot as a kid, I occasionally enjoy trying out the latest games to see how far we've come. Most recently I've been enjoying Zelda: Breath of the Wild and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. I also like following efforts to beat video games I'd play as a kid with reinforcement learning (e.g., [Pokemon Red Experiments](https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments)) - we've come a long way!
