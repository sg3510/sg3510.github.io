# Hi I'm Seb

I'm currently exploring different startup ideas. My main interests are solving hard problems with technical products but more specifically in the areas of AI, health and consumer products.

I enjoy both writing software but also making it scale to millions (or billions) of users - this has led me to jump between the roles of software engineer and a PM at various companies including:

- **Hedge Labs:** I started a collateralised lending product (Hedge Protocol) and pivoted to a LLM-powered food logging app (Amino).
- **Google:** I joined as part of the APM program and worked on various products including YouTube, Android and Pixel.
- **Home Automation Startup:** Shortly after graduating I spent a year working as a machine learning engineer building sound recognition neural networks for a home automation device.
- **ARM:** I interned there for two summers as a software engineer and a PM, mostly working on the Cortex-M processors.
