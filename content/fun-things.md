# Fun Things

- [Pokemon Tileset Viewer](https://sebgrubb.com/pokemon-tileset/): A fun project I made to read and display tilesets and blocksets from Pokemon Yellow in a browser. In Pokemon, each map is made of a grid of 16x16 pixel squares. Each square is composed of four 8x8 pixel tiles. This was done since Pokemon Yellow had to fit in *just* 503 KB of ROM so devs had to get very creative with how they stored the graphics data.
